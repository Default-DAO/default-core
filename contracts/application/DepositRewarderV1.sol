// The Default version of the Masterchef contract. We distribute rewards using the same principle.
// For formal paper for this strategy, see: https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad71ffeb79acc67c8bcdaba/5ad8d1193a40977462982470_scalable-reward-distribution-paper.pdf
// Calculating rewards is tricky. We are using a contract with logic derived from the OG rewards contract,Sushiswap's Masterchef.sol: 
// https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/master/contracts/MasterChef.sol

// Copied verbatim from the original contract:

    // We do some fancy math here. Basically, any point in time, the amount of SUSHIs
    // entitled to a user but is pending to be distributed is:
    //
    //   pending reward = (user.amount * pool.accSushiPerShare) - user.rewardDebt
    //
    // Whenever a user deposits or withdraws LP tokens to a pool. Here's what happens:
    //   1. The pool's `accSushiPerShare` (and `lastRewardBlock`) gets updated.
    //   2. User receives the pending reward sent to his/her address.
    //   3. User's `amount` gets updated.
    //   4. User's `rewardDebt` gets updated.

// Default's rewarder uses the same mechanism but with drastically simplified logic:
// 1. we have a single pool (USDC Vault), so we can remove all pool allocation logic
// 2. distribution epochs are weeklyÂ instead of per block, so 
// 3. there is no special multiplier logic for early participants
// 4. minting happens outside the contract, and reward tokens are sent in (instead of directly minted)

// note: we are also changing the "rewardDebt" variable to "ineligbleRewards" for contract clarity.

// Here's our very first balance sheet mining contract. In the words of a notorious chef:

    // Have fun reading it. Hopefully it's bug-free. God bless.
